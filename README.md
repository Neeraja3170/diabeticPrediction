# ðŸ©º Diabetic Prediction Project

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related attributes such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, age, and blood pressure. The model is built using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and aims to assist in early diagnosis and preventive care.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- Supervised machine learning applied to real-world medical data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature importance
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
- Evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Basic web interface for user input and real-time predictions

## ðŸ¤– Algorithms Used

- **Logistic Regression** â€“ for binary classification
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** â€“ based on feature similarity
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** â€“ to find optimal decision boundaries
- **Random Forest Classifier** â€“ ensemble of decision trees
- **Decision Tree** â€“ tree-based classification

The best-performing model is selected and deployed using a simple web interface.

## ðŸ“ˆ Goal

To provide a predictive tool that can help in early detection of diabetes and raise awareness about key health indicators.
